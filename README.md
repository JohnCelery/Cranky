# Cranky Moon

Cranky Moon is a modern, mobile‑first e-commerce site for selling sewing patterns, digital downloads, and handmade crafts.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- Stripe Checkout (test‑mode first)
- Deployed on Vercel (free tier)

## Local Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Building

The repository ships with a simple placeholder build script so that `npm run build`
works even in offline environments. It generates static files in the `dist`
directory. Install the dependencies first if you want to run the full Next.js
build.
